# Sustainable Fashion Prototyping Pipeline

## Purpose
This project centralizes digital assets and manages virtual prototyping workflows to reduce physical sampling, enable faster design iterations, and promote sustainable, circular fashion development.

## Key Goals
- Reduce physical sample shipments and material waste
- Enable faster design iterations through virtual testing
- Build a reusable library of digital assets (avatars, materials, patterns)
- Streamline collaboration between designers, pattern makers, and stakeholders
- Support AR/VR try-ons and virtual fitting rooms
- Promote sustainability and circular economy in fashion

## Repository Structure
- `/avatars` – 3D avatar models for virtual fitting
- `/garments` – Digital garment designs and prototypes
- `/materials` – Material definitions and textures
- `/tests` – Test scripts and validation results

## Workflow
1. Designers create digital garments in `/garments`
2. Fit tests are requested via GitHub Issues with target avatars and materials
3. Pull requests are used to review and merge new designs
4. Releases tag stable versions of the asset library
5. Virtual try‑ons and AR previews are generated from approved assets

## Getting Started
Clone the repository and explore the folders. Refer to the issue tracker for ongoing fit tests and design tasks.
