# Avatars

This directory stores 3D avatar models used for virtual fitting and digital prototyping.

Each avatar file should be in a standard format (e.g., .obj, .fbx) and include metadata about body measurements, pose, and intended use.

Example: `Avatar_Male_01.obj` – Male avatar with standard sizing.
